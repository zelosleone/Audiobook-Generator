An Open Source text-to-speech system built by inverting Whisper. Previously known as spear-tts-pytorch.

We want this model to be like Stable Diffusion but for speech â€“ both powerful and easily customizable.

We are working only with properly licensed speech recordings and all the code is Open Source so the model will be always safe to use for commercial applications.

Currently the models are trained on the English LibreLight dataset. In the next release we want to target multiple languages (Whisper and EnCodec are both multilanguage).
